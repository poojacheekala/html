        <h2>story</h2>
        <p>In a land far far away there was a glorious kingdom. In the kingdom stood a great castle. And inside the castle lived a handsome Prince. </p>
        <h2>elaboration</h2>
        <p>He longed for a true Princess to share his castle and kingdom, but he couldn't find one.</p>
        <h2>description</h2> 
             was not because there was a lack of Princesses. In fact, the kingdom was full of fair maidens all claiming to be Princesses. The Prince scoured the kingdom, meeting every one of these so-called Princesses. But he returned sad and empty handed.
 “It is impossible to tell whether these are true Princesses!” he said to his Father, the King.“You must be patient my son. You will know when you know” said the King.</p>
